Arizona Tree is a web-based application designed to provide users with insights into the canopy coverage of a given location. By entering an address or location, users can explore an interactive map to visualize the tree canopy and receive a percentage of tree coverage in that area.

## Features
- Interactive Map: Users can input a location to view a satellite map of the area.
- Canopy Coverage Detection: The application scans the entered location to detect the percentage of tree canopy coverage.
- Visual Highlighting: After scanning, the tool highlights all trees in the area and provides a visual representation of canopy density.
- Customizable Search: Users can zoom in, out, or move around the map for detailed examination of different areas.

## Technologies
- Tailwind CSS for efficient styling and responsive design.
- Python for backend logic and processing canopy data.
- HTML5 for structuring the web content.
- Bun as the JavaScript runtime to handle server-side logic and build tasks.
